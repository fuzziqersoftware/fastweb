fastweb is a very simple HTTP server for static files.

fastweb is designed to serve a small amount of static data to a large number of
clients. On startup, it loads all the files in all the given data directories
into memory so they can be served without any unnecessary data copying. It also
generates compressed versions of each file for fast responses to clients that
support the gzip content encoding.

fastweb supports reloading the dataset or updating the executable with no
downtime. To do so, send the existing server process a SIGHUP.

Run fastweb with no arguments to see how to use it. For most use cases, the
following arguments suffice:
  /path/to/fastweb --listen=$PORT $DATA_DIRECTORY
